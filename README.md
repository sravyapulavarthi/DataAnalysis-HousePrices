# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

The House Prices dataset is a great dataset to apply intermediate machine learning algorithms. The dataset basically aims to predict the house prices of a neighborhood located in Ames, Iowa. The final goal is to predict the final price of each home located in the neighborhood. This dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. 

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges us to predict the final price of each home.

Before applying machine learning techniques and algorithms, our goal was to reduce the number of variables from 79 to 22 significant variables, and thus one of the first task at hand was data preparation and to make sure there was no missing data, and no outliers which might potentially skew the analysis.
